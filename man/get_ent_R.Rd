\title{Calculate the correlation coefficient a multivariate normal with all
pairwise correlations equal that has an entropy equivalent to the
observed entropy.}
\usage{
get_ent_R(Omega, min_ent = 0.01, max_ent = 0.99, tol = 1e-14)
}
\arguments{
\item{Omega}{An n_iter x n_traits x n_traits array of correlation matrices}

\item{min_ent}{The minimum entropy at which to begin the binary search}

\item{max_ent}{The maximum entropy at which to begin the binary search}

\item{tol}{Stop the search when the entropy difference is less than tol}
}
\value{
A vector of r equivalents, i.e., the pairwise corrleation in a
constant correlation matrix producing entropies equivalent to those in
the vector of entropies supplied
}
\description{
