Title: Distance regression with multimembership random effects
Version: 0.1
Author: Kent Holsinger <kent.holsinger@uconn.edu>
Maintainer: Kent Holsinger <kent.holsinger@uconn.edu>
Description: This package regresses genetic distances lying in (0, 1) on a set of covariate distances. It uses multimembership random effects to reduce the covariance of residuals. Three models of multimembership random effects are available: MM (additive multimembership - as in brms), MMCAR (additive multimembership with multivariate normal prior based on spatial distances), SDMM (squared difference multimembership - as in spGDMMM - with multivariate normal prior based on spatial distances.
